		    	The primary function of our project is to serve as a database for a veterinary
				hospital, utilizing a web application in order to set up appointments between pet
				owners on behalf of their pets and the veterinarians. The primary user of the
				database would be the support staff of the hospital, who would be the one
				arranging the appointments on behalf of the veterinarian.
				<br><br>
				The system contains a set of six tables: User, PetOwner, Contact, Animal,
				Veterinarian and Appointment. The purpose of the User table is to provide a list
				of authorized users of the database to authenticate against for purposes of
				logging in to the database. The PetOwner table provides a list of the various
				owners who would be making appointments on behalf of their pets (descriptions
				of which are found in the Animal table, tied to their owner), with the Contact
				table providing the essential contact details for each owner. The Veterinarian
				table provides the essential reference information for each veterinarian, with the
				Appointment table being used to hold the information for the actual
				appointments, once made.
				<br><br>
				These tables are tied together with a user interface system which would carry out
				the primary function of the project: to set up or adjust appointments between
				clients and the veterinarians. The function being carried out uses the
				appointment table to store the essential information from the other tables to
				refer to each involved party while also adding the necessary identification of the
				date and time of the appointment
